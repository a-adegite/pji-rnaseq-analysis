# RNA-seq Analysis of Acute and Chronic Periprosthetic Joint Infection (PJI) Isolates
This project investigates the transcriptional differences between acute and chronic Periprosthetic Joint Infection (PJI) isolates using RNA-seq data. The goal is to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) that may contribute to infection persistence, biofilm formation, and host‚Äìpathogen interactions.

## üîß Pipeline Overview

The pipeline processes paired-end RNA-seq reads to identify differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs between ECFCs from SCD patients with and without ischemic stroke.  

1. **Data Acquisition** 
2. **Quality Control** 
3. **Read Trimming** 
4. **Read Alignment** 
5. **Quantification** 
6. **Differential Expression Analysis** 
7. **Annotation** 
8. **Functional Enrichment** ‚Äî Use clusterProfiler to perform GO and KEGG pathway enrichment for correlated coding genes.  
9. **Visualization**
