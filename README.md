# RNA-seq Analysis of Acute and Chronic Periprosthetic Joint Infection (PJI) Isolates
This project investigates the transcriptional differences between acute and chronic Periprosthetic Joint Infection (PJI) isolates using RNA-seq data. The goal is to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) that may contribute to infection persistence, biofilm formation, and host‚Äìpathogen interactions.

## üîß Pipeline Overview
This pipeline processes paired-end RNA-seq FASTQ files from Staphylococcus aureus isolates to identify transcriptional differences between acute and chronic phases of periprosthetic joint infection (PJI).

## üöÄ How to Run
```
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Ensure that all required tools are installed and accessible in your system's `$PATH`.

## üì¶ Data Access

Due to GitHub file size restrictions, input FASTQ files and some intermediate outputs are **not included** in this repository.

To obtain the required data:

- Run `scripts/download_data.sh` which fetches all required files from public repositories, or  
- Manually download them using the accession numbers or URLs referenced inside the script
